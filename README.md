# Langebio Faculty Retreat 2015

Hello, this is a small webpage with basic information about our Faculty retreat. The idea is to meet over two days to discuss about our future scientific plans as groups and as a institution


## Where?

- Hotel [Hacienda Jurica](https://www.lasbrisashotels.com.mx/es/queretaro/) in Querétaro.


## When?

- February 23-24.

We will start our sessions at 14:00 on Thursday. The plan is to leave Langebio around 10:00-10:30 to arrive to Querétaro around 12:30. Lunch will be served at 13:00 and we will start the sessions at 14:00

## Format

We will have four sessions with two speakers per session. Each speaker will have a full hour in which you will explain our current and futures plans for our labs. You can be more or less specific depending on what you want to get from this meeting. Time for presentation should not go over 30 min to give ample time fro discussion. Presentations should actually encourage discussion and participation by the rest of the colleagues.
